I can't think of a good name yet for this game but it is an incremental / idle game. The idea is to manage a civilization starting from a house with 2 sim up to a super power nation. I might add more features but my current goal is to successfully build a basic incremental app. 

The application is built on HTML5 using javascript. As of right now the app is built with the help of third party libraries such as [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), [JQuery](https://jquery.com), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

There are a few games that inspired me to make this game, but two of the most influential are [Swarm Simulator](https://swarmsim.github.io) and [Pixels Filling Squares Dx](https://www.kongregate.com/games/Moczan/pixels-filling-squares-dx).
