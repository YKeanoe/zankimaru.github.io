Third year assignment from RMIT to develop a web application for a company running a car sharing scheme. The company owns a number of cars which can be parked at a number of locations in the city. Users of the scheme will take a car for some period of time, use it and then return it to an empty location. 
The system needs to provide the necessary transactions and data management to support this kind of business. The system features include databases for users, cars, bookings, and running cars, filtering features to find the best cars to rent, making reports for both cars and users history, and platform independent. The system delivered include a server, web application, cloud database, and documentations.
My role in the project is as both Back-end and Front-end developer. Making sure the web application and dashboard features/UI work properly.
