Third year project for RMIT Interactive Digital Media Project A. The project gave us a creative control to develop any type of game in any platform. We decided to create a 2.5D RPG fighting game for windows pc. The project was done in unity with assets created in Photoshop or Maya, animated in Flash, and then programmed in Javascript or C#. The game is delivered with a fully playable first level. The game feature include variety of enemies to defeat using 3 types of playable character. 
In this project, I was assigned to develop the code for the game, enemies design, and both enemies and characters animations.
